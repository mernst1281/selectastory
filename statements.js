You look down at the plate and notice a stray sesame seed on the bagel, so you flick it off. \
Yawnkay has been doing the color diet for the last couple of months. He's only allowed to eat one color food at a time, and that sesame seed would be counted as beige, not white. \
But even though it's been difficult working for him, you've gotten to do and see incredible things. Love him or hate him, Yawnkay is one of the most famous musicians on the planet, and he's married to Mimm May, the most famous social media slash reality star in the world. \
With Yawnkay, you've gotten to travel. In fact, you've fetched food for him on almost every continent. \
(Antarctica doesn't have enough fans on it to attract Yawnkay's attention.)<break time:'.1s'/> \
You walk into his bedroom and notice a pill bottle lying on the floor. That's odd. Yawnkay is very tidy. \
Or rather, Yawnkay demands that his staff be very tidy. \
You place the tray on the table next to his bed and stop for a moment to look at the curtains surrounding his eight-poster bed. Never wanting to be outdone, Yawnkay had four posts added beyond the traditional four. \
You begin to walk out of the room—Yawnkay doesn't like anyone to linger—but you can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. \
You stand perfectly still and listen carefully. Though Yawnkay would never admit it, he has a bit of sleep apnea, so you can usually hear him snoring. \
But not today. It's perfectly quiet. \
You tiptoe over to his bed and slowly pull back the curtain. \
Yawnkay lies atop his down comforters, his eyes open. \
Dear Lord, he's dead! \
You feel for a pulse because that's what people in the movies do, but he's definitely gone. \
What in Yeezus's name are you going to do? \
<break time='.5s'/>Do you want to, <emphasis>1</emphasis>, call the police, or, <emphasis>2</emphasis>, find the bodyguard?",

You lift the receiver and dial 911. You tell the dispatcher that you’re at Yawnkay East’s pent house in Manhattan and that he’s not breathing. You ask them to send someone right away. \
You run downstairs to wait for the police to arrive and see Yawnkay’s bodyguard. \
He scowls at you. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard1.mp3' /> \
You tell him that Yawnkay’s dead and that you’ve called the cops who are on the way. \

Jeez, you think. Shouldn’t he be more surprised about Yawnkay’s death? \
The bodyguard waits with you in the foyer, a seven-hundred pound chandelier hanging above your heads. The ten minutes it takes for the police to show up feels like an eternity, but eventually sirens blare outside. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard3.mp3' /> \
You’ve never had to deal with a dead boss, you think to yourself, but you keep quiet. \
<break time='.5s'/>A firm fist pounds on the door. \
You open the door to half a dozen uniformed officers and a couple of detectives in blue suits. They pour into the penthouse. While most of them head toward Yawnkay’s bedroom, one of the detectives leads you over to a couch in sitting room number four. \
The officer sternly tells you that he needs to ask you a few questions. There is nothing at all friendly-looking about him. \
He asks you what the heck happened here this morning. \
You know you haven’t done anything wrong, but the way he’s talking is freaking you out. \

You jog downstairs to the foyer and quickly find him. It dawns on you that you've worked for Yawnkay for two years and yet don't know the bodyguard's name. \
'Umm, Mr. Bodyguard, sir,' you stutter. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard4.mp3' /> \
How do you tell someone that your boss is dead? \
Well, there's one obvious way. \
'Yawnkay is dead,' you say. \
The bodyguard scowls. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard5.mp3' /> \
He pulls out his cellphone and dials a number. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard6.mp3' /> \
He hangs up the phone. \
<audio src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/selectaskill/audio-1/bodyguard7.mp3' /> \
As you wait for the police to arrive, you wonder why he didn't want to see Yawnkay for himself. You guess you should feel flattered that he trusted your assessment of Yawnkay's deadness, but it still seems odd. \
A few minutes later, a person knocks softly on the door. Unlike any cop knock you've ever heard. \
The bodyguard opens the door and two men in blue suits walk in. The bodyguard shows one of them to Yawnkay's bedroom and the other one escorts you to a couch in sitting room number nine. \
He asks you what happened here. \
You open your mouth to answer and only a croak comes out. You know you haven't done anything wrong, but still, you're nervous. A famous man is dead, and you've seen enough Law and Order to know that you're supposed to ask for an attorney. Or maybe you're overthinking this? \

Wait, what? Suicide? Yawnkay could be a bit eccentric, but one thing that surprised you working for him was how, well, not evil he was. \
Sure, he was self-involved. And he had an absurd entourage. And his wife, was, well—everyone knows Mimm May. And there was that time he interrupted Tyler Quick at those music awards.

You could say she was a golden woman. You’d never say Golden Girl, because she’s clearly a boss woman, and also copyright or trademark or something. \

Hmm. Where to start? You weren’t with Yawnkay last night, so you’re not sure what he was doing. As his assistant, you only get to travel with him when he leaves New York City. Otherwise, you stay in, at the ready in your room two wings over from his. \
You go the obvious investigatory route and check Instagram. When you open the app on your phone, you sigh at your number of followers. 467. That’s two less than when you checked this morning. Who the heck unfollows someone at nine in the morning? \
You scroll through your feed. \
Mimm May checked in at a restaurant in Calabasas yesterday. Even though she and Yawnkay have been married for a few years and have a couple of kids, she still spends most of her time on the west coast while he prefers New York. \
You keep scrolling, and see yet another Insta argument between Bob May and his on-again off-again girlfriend Grey Korea. You look at the location tags and are surprised to see that both Bob and Korea are in New York City. \
There are two pieces of information that everyone knows about Bob May: (1) he designs manklets, and (2) he rarely leaves his house in California. \
Well, there’s also the weight gain and loss, but you are above weight shaming. \
In any event, it’s odd for Bob to be in the city. \
You keep scrolling, and come across a picture of Yawnkay’s mother in law Christy Benner. It’s a bathroom selfie that would be far more appropriate for a nineteen-year-old than a woman in her—you know, you’re not sure how old Christy is. \
She doesn’t look as old as she certainly must be, but somehow she’s also avoided looking like she’s gone under the knife three too many times. You’ll have to look into her plastic surgeon. \
There’s no location tag on the shot, but in the mirror you notice some hotel-sized soaps. You zoom in and read the name of a swanky Manhattan hotel. She’s in New York too? It’s almost like someone is setting this up so it’s not at all certain who the killer is. \
You chuckle to yourself. That’s silly. There is clearly no design to the crazy universe you live in. \
You keep scrolling, and finally hit on Yawnkay’s whereabouts. He was at Just Seeds last night. Just Seeds is the coolest new restaurant in town, which should be surprising because, as the name suggests, it serves only seeds. Like, nothing but seeds. Raw seeds. \
But look who else was there: <break time:'.1s'/>his longtime nemesis and pop star Tyler Quick. That can’t be a coincidence, can it? \

It’s easy to forget Bob. \
Or, at least it was until he started dating Grey Korea. \
Before he got with her, it seemed like he was nothing more than an unmotivated rich kid who made just enough money off his manklet empire to never leave the house. \
Since he started dating Korea, however, it’s become clear that Bob <emphasis level:'strong'>is</emphasis> a spoiled rich kid, but one who likes getting in very public and very embarrassing fights with any woman who would deign to procreate with him. \
Clearly then, he has more personality than you’d originally given him credit for. Although, is that a good thing when that personality is so terrible? \
You go to Bob’s Instagram feed. Between when you first looked at Instagram and now, his posts about Grey Korea have been taken down. \
Oh wait, according to people, he’s still posting over on Twitter. You check his Twitter feed and see that he’s now tweeting screen shots of his Instagram posts. What a winner. \
The good thing is, he’s still in New York. \
You check your favorite celebrity blog and find an item that says he was spotted going into one of the condos at 6 6 6 Fifth Avenue. You don’t keep up with politics much, but isn’t that the president’s son-in-law’s building? It’s hard not to believe the world you live in is made up when the president’s son-in-law would own a building with the address of 6 6 6. \
You go out the back door of Yawnkay’s building to avoid any poparazzi and take a Lyft to 6 6 6 Fifth Avenue. \
The blocky building rises before you. You flash security your Yawnkay East card, and they let you take the elevator up to Bob’s floor. \
As you stand in front of the door to Bob’s condo, it dawns on you that you hadn’t really come up with a plan. \
You look at the door handle and notice something: the door isn’t completely latched. You could just walk in. But is that a good idea? \

Thankfully you’ve learned from your time with Yawnkay that if you stride ahead with your head high acting like you belong some place, people generally won’t question you. \
You climb the red-carpeted stairs and enter a gilded foyer that looks like it was designed by Marie Antoinette.  \
You march forward confidently, but then it dawns on you that you don’t know which room Christy is in. \
You pull out your phone and look at your favorite celebrity blog, but no one is talking about Christy. You roll your eyes. Boy is she going to be pissed. \

If you asked 100 random people off the street 'who do you think would want to kill Yawnkay East?' the top three answers you’d get would be his nemesis Tyler Quick, George W. Bush, or Yawnkay himself, so that no one else could take credit. \
You’re convinced he didn’t kill himself. And you’re pretty sure the former president has better things to do with his time, so that leaves Tyler as the remaining major suspect. \
You pull up your favorite celebrity gossip website on your phone. You see an item about a rumor that Yawnkay is dead, but thankfully that rumor has gone around so many times, at this point, no one believes it. \
You come across an article about the event last night at Just Seeds. \
Apparently it was a private party hosted by pop star Kelly Purry. Why would Yawnkay have gone to that? \
Unfortunately there are no detailed reports of what happened because the event was closed to the public. A few pictures have already leaked, but nothing that interesting. A selfie by some random attendee. A picture of a pile of seeds. A shot of the outside of the restaurant. \
There’s only one picture that catches your attention. In it, Yawnkay stands between Kelly Purry and Tyler Quick, his arms around both of them. They’re all smiling. \
It’s strange to look at. It’s probably the last picture taken of him alive. \
You need to talk to Tyler. But how? \
Usually you’d bust out your Yawnkay East card, which almost never fails in gaining you access, but you highly doubt that would help you get past Tyler Quick’s security. They might’ve taken a happy selfie together last night, but that doesn’t mean they’re BFFs or that her bodyguard would let one of Yawnkay’s people through.

Finally you hear a noise. The sound is a cross between chipmunks chirping and pigs grunting. \
You tiptoe toward the noise and enter an open living room with lux furnishings. \
You can hear the sound better now, so either it’s getting louder, or you’re getting closer, or both. \
You tiptoe down the hallway until you’re in front of a door, the sounds emanating from behind it. \
Now that they’re clearer, you’re pretty sure a human is making these noises. \
A human woman. \
Is Bob here with someone? \
You aren’t aware of any women he’s been with lately other than Grey Korea, but the yips of delight you’re hearing couldn’t possibly be coming from her. Not after those Instagram and twitter posts. \

	text90 :  "'Hi Tyler,' you say. 'Big fan.' \
She motions you toward a chair. \
'And your latest video,' you say, 'the one where you play different versions of yourself. Brilliant.' \
 'No, it was great,' you say. \
She rises and walks toward a snack table. \
'Umm, sure,' you say. You’re not a fan of seltzer water, but you red that if you let people do small favors for you, they’ll do larger ones afterward. Now’s your chance. \
'Can I ask you a couple of questions about last night?' you say. \
She hands you a LaCroy and then flops down on her overstuffed chair. \

	text95 : "'You’ll tell it to their face,' you say, 'or murder them.' \
The accusation hangs in the air for a moment. \
 'Yawnkay was found dead this morning. In fact, you might have been one of the last people to see him alive.' \
 'Then who do you think did?' you ask. \
 'My name is—' you start, but before you finish the sentence, a security guard drags you from the room.",

	text96 : "'Yawnkay died last night,' you tell her. You watch closely for her reaction to the news. \
 'Yeah, someone murdered him,' you say. 'You’re one of the last people on earth to see him alive.' \
Her eyes widen and she sits up in her chair. \
'If it wasn’t you,' you say, 'then who do you think did it?' \
 'Is there anything else you can tell me about last night?' you ask. 'Anything that might help me figure out who Yawnkay’s murderer is?' \
You look at her for a long moment and you’re almost positive she’s telling the truth. Her mannerisms suggest she’s being honest, but also, she assumed Yawnkay was shot, when, in reality, he died from pills. \
But if she didn’t do it, who did?",

	text97 : "You look around at the people assembled in Yawnkay’s lucky sitting room number seven. \
The bodyguard glances nervously at Christy Benner who sits next to her daughter Mimm May. Sikh Meriano sits on Mimm’s other side, stroking her ridiculously coiffed hair. \
Tyler Quick is on the far side of the room from Kelly Purry and Tim Hoodleston, glaring daggers at them. \
You look at Bob May who awkwardly stands next to Grey Korea. Tangerine Tulip sits on a chair near them, both of her eyes blackened and her nose swollen. \
You’re convinced Yawnkay’s murderer is in this room, but who is it? No options this time. Just state the name of the person you think is the murderer. Or if you’d like to hear a description of the people in the room repeated say, 'repeat'.",

	text100 : "'It was Yawnkay himself,' you blurt out. \
Everyone looks at you confused. \
Mimm May raises an eyebrow. \
Bob May pipes in. \
'True,' you say, 'but it would be peak Yawnkay to know someone else was going to murder him and try to overshadow their accomplishment by killing himself first.' \
Mimm May looks at you skeptically. \
You think for a long moment. There really is no point to that. Plus, what Bob May said is true. Yawnkay would not have killed himself on white food day. As silly as it is, that’s the entire foundation of your investigation and you haven’t learned a single piece of information to counter that fact. \
'I’m so sorry,' you say. 'I am an idiot who obviously didn’t deserve to be in Yawnkay’s employ.' \
You slink out of the room. \
Since you’d lived with Yawnkay for the past two years, now that he’s dead, you have nowhere to live. You move into your parents’ basement. \
You look for work, but no one will hire the person who found their boss dead, went through an entire investigation to figure out who killed him, and then literally blamed the victim. \
On your deathbed your last thought is, 'I truly am an idiot!'",

	text101 : "'I did it,' you blurt out. \
Wait, why in the heck would you accuse yourself? You’re positive you didn’t do it. \
It’s almost as if there’s a disembodied voice telling you what to say, and you can’t help but comply. What sort of horrible world is this that you’re living in? \
Mimm May jumps up from her seat. \
'Wait no,' you say. 'I didn’t do it. Someone made me say that.' \
The bodyguard narrows his eyes at you. \
He moves toward you menacingly. \
'No. I swear,' you say. 'It wasn’t me. I don’t know why I said that. I’ve done so much to find Yawnkay’s murderer. Why would I go to all that trouble if I had killed him? Especially considering that the police are convinced he committed suicide,' you finish. \
The security guard doesn’t look convinced. \
He takes you to the police station. \
After sitting in jail for six months awaiting trial, you’re eventually convicted by a jury of your peers. Even though there was basically no evidence against you, making their verdict extremely stupid, this is fair because you were the idiot who confessed to a crime you didn’t commit under absolutely no pressure to do so. \
You go to prison for only two years because no one was that broken up about Yawnkay’s death. \
On your release, you pen a book about your experiences. It’s a cross between Why I Did It and Orange is the New Black. \
This book makes even more money than the publisher expected, and you go on to write a series of memoirs about your time with Yawnkay. \
You ultimately retire to the Hamptons, and even though your life turns out pretty great, you always feel like a jackass for accusing yourself of murder for no apparent reason. \
And moreover, you have to always wonder: who did kill Yawnkay, and if you had discovered the answer, would it have been funny?",

	text102 : "'It was noted uh gore uh phobe and manklet designer, Bob May!' you declare, pointing right at Bob. \
Grey Korea looks shocked, but a huge smirk spreads across Tangerine Tulip’s face. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Bob’s guilty, he’ll tell you now. \
You think for a long moment. \
Why would Bob kill Yawnkay? \
'You tell me,' you say finally. \
Your shoulders drop. 'Well, then what were you doing in New York?' you ask. \
 'So you being in New York had absolutely nothing to do with Yawnkay?' you ask, deflated. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible so they all leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement. You assume you’ll never hear from any of these people again, until you get a call on your cellphone a few weeks later. \
It’s Bob May. \
Great, he’s called to rub it in, you think. \
He goes on to offer you a job working for his manklet design company and you take him up on it. The two of you become surprisingly successful after you realize it’d be a better idea to call them wanklets and market them to women. \
Eventually, you star in a reality show about the business. \
At the end of your life you’re sitting on a beach, sipping a peen-ya colada, and you’re happy, but you can’t help but wonder who had killed Yawnkay and how your life would have turned out had you figured it out.",

	text103 :  "'It was Tangerine Tulip!' you declare, pointing right at Tangerine. \
Grey Korea looks shocked, but a huge smirk spreads across Bob May’s face. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Tangerine’s guilty, she’ll tell you now. \
She rolls her eyes. \
'You’re telling me,' you say, 'that you broke in Yawnkay’s house the night he was murdered, but you didn’t kill him?' \
 'You better tell me everything,' you say, 'if you want me to believe it.' \
You look over to Grey Korea and she nods vigorously. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You think it’ll all blow over and then you can move on with your life, but apparently Tangerine Tulip doesn’t feel the same way. She talks crap about you during every media appearance. She even devotes a few minutes of every podcast to talking about how terrible you are and somehow her podcast takes off. \
No matter where you go, you get booed. \
It gets to the point where you never come out of your parents’ house. At the end of your life, as you’re lying on your mattress down in the basement, you wonder if you would’ve ended up so miserably if you’d actually figured out who the murderer was.", 

	text104 :  "'It was Grey Korea!' you declare, pointing right at Korea. \
Tangerine Tulip and Bob May both look shocked. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Korea’s guilty, she’ll tell you now. \
She looks pissed. \
You wrack your brain trying to come up with a reason. \
Sure, you can’t understand why Grey Korea is interested in Bob May, and yeah, it’s weird that Korea’s best friend Tangerine Tulip is also the ex of her baby daddy’s brother in law. \
(Say that three times fast.) \
The whole thing is rather incestuous. \
But still, you can’t see why Grey Korea would want Yawnkay dead. There was never any beef between them as far as you know. \
'If you didn’t kill him,' you ask, 'then why are you in New York City?' \
You look over to Tangerine Tulip and she nods vigorously. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You think it’ll all blow over and then you can move on with your life, but apparently Grey Korea doesn’t feel the same way. \
She makes an auto-tuned video of you out of appearances you did with Yawnkay before his death. In it, you sing about how you’re a loser. \
Surprisingly, the thing goes viral. At first you’re really embarrassed, but then you embrace the fame. You parlay your D-list celebrity status into an appearance on Big Brother where you get second place. \
The rest of your life goes fairly smoothly. You somehow always manage to stay on the D-list, but you never rise any higher. \
At the end of your life, when you’re in the makeup chair for your appearance on the sixth hour of the Today show, you stop to wonder, who was the one who actually killed Yawnkay, and if you were smarter, would you have figured it out?",

	text105 :  "'It was Mimm May!' you declare, pointing right at Mimm. \
Sikh Meriano and Christy Benner look shocked. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Mimm’s guilty, she’ll tell you now. \
Mimm jumps up, here hair not moving a wisp. It’s curled and teased like she’s planning to audition for Designing Women. \
'First things first,' you say. 'What’s with your hair?' \
You might have a low opinion of New Jersey but even you know that they aren’t that bad. \
'If you didn’t kill him,' you say, 'then why were you in New York telling everyone you were in Calabasas?' \
She trails off and starts sobbing. \
You apologize for upsetting her, but she won’t hear it. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You think it’ll all blow over and then you can move on with your life, but apparently Mimm May doesn’t feel the same way. \
A few months later you’re served with a complaint for slander. Apparently it’s not a good idea to wrongly accuse people of murder, especially when they’re loaded. \
You defend yourself at trial because you can’t afford to hire an attorney. You lose, and a judgment of three million dollars is entered against you. You don’t have three million dollars so you go bankrupt. \
After that, you have a hard time getting your life back on track. You eventually get a job as a school crossing guard, and, frankly, you really enjoy it. At the end of your life, you’re proud of all the kids you saved from getting run over by cars. \
You always have to wonder, though, who actually did kill Yawnkay, and if you were smarter, could you have caught them?",

	text106 :  "'It was Sikh Meriano!' you declare, pointing right at Sikh. \
Mimm May and Christy Benner look shocked. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Sikh’s guilty, he’ll tell you now. \
That’s a good question. Why do you think Sikh did it? \
'If you didn’t do it,' you say, 'then why are you with Mimm?' \
 'So what you’re telling me,' you say, 'is that if Yawnkay weren’t around, it’d be easier for you to get your designs on Mimm May.' \
He makes a very solid point. You look around sheepishly. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You think it’ll all blow over and then you can move on with your life, but apparently Sikh Meriano doesn’t feel the same way. \
He starts a flame war with you on twitter. \
You call him up six months later to try to squash the beef, and you get into a long conversation. Apparently Sikh was supposed to be going on a reality show with his boyfriend about their relationship issues, but he’d just been dumped this morning. \
He asks if you’d like to go on the show with him instead. You both could make a big show out of reconciling, and it’d help both of your reputations. \
You agree. You go on the show and have a good time. It never leads to any other fame, D-list or otherwise. Although, it does get Sikh off your back. \
You bounce around for a few years and finally decide to go to law school. You really enjoyed that one paralegal class, so what the heck. \
You love law school, but you end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. You get a job interpreting boring insurance contracts, but you can’t quit it because you have to be able to pay off your debt.  \
You have a few regrets in your eventually long life, but there’s one you can never quite get over. The regret of never knowing who actually killed Yawnkay, and the fact that you never brought that person to justice.",

	text107 :   "'It was Christy Benner!' you declare, pointing right at Christy. \
Sikh Meriano and Christy Benner look shocked. \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \
So if Christy’s guilty, she’ll tell you now. \
 'Because before Mimm May married Yawnkay,' you say, 'she was your favorite child. But now you don’t have as much control over her as you used to.' \
She’s not wrong. \
The bodyguard steps forward. \
Christy runs to him and puts her hand over his mouth. \
This wasn’t how you expected this to go, but if you get a confession out of it, that’s all that matters. \
'So you killed Yawnkay?' you ask. \
The bodyguard sniffles. \
'What does this have to do with Christy Benner?' you ask. \
Everyone in the room gasps. \
 'Aren’t you way too young to be dating someone of her age, no offense,' you say. \
Christy pipes up again. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
The bodyguard’s accusation that you’re a sexist keeps pinging around in your brain. \
You reed a lot of second wave feminist texts and become obsessed. You eventually go back to school and ultimately get your Ph.D in women’s studies. \
You have a lot going against you, but after you graduate, you even land a professorship at a top university. \
At the end of your life, you’re satisfied knowing that you’ve truly made a difference in the world. \
Every once in a while you still wonder who actually killed Yawnkay, but then you realize you have more pressing things to consider.",

So if the bodyguard’s guilty, he’ll tell you now. \
Yes! You knew if you picked the right person they’d confess. \
'So you murdered Yawnkay,' you say. 'But why?' \
The bodyguard sniffles. \
'Why did you sneak out?' you ask. \
Everyone in the room gasps. \

	text109 :  "'It was Tyler Quick!' you declare, pointing right at her. \
Kelly Purry puts her hand over her mouth and Tim Hoodleston smiles.  \
You’ve watched enough detective shows to know that when a guilty person is accused of murder, they always confess. Plus that’s what they taught you in that one paralegal class you took. Boy has that class come in handy. \

 'Interesting,' you say. 'Is that why you invited Yawnkay too? Even bigger publicity?' \
'Then why did you take a picture with him?' you ask. \
 'What did you do when you realized it was Yawnkay?' you ask. \
Tyler flips her hair dramatically. \
Tyler looks pointedly at Kelly Purry, and Kelly rolls her eyes. \
Mimm May scowls at Tyler but keeps her mouth shut. \
'Well, then I guess you didn’t do it,' you say finally. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You think it’ll all blow over and then you can move on, but apparently Tyler Quick doesn’t feel the same way. \
On her tour, she unveils a new song called, 'I would never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever kill Yawnkay East.' Your name isn’t in the title, but she references you throughout the song. \
Rabid Tyler Quick fans start stalking you wherever you go, and not in a good way. \
No matter where you go, you get booed. \
It gets to the point where you never come out of your parents’ house. At the end of your life, as you’re lying on your mattress down in the basement, you wonder if you would’ve ended up so miserably if you’d actually figured out who the murderer was.",

So if Tim Hoodleston’s guilty, he’ll tell you now. \
 'Exactly!' you say. 'If you didn’t do it, why are you here?' \
Oh yeah, you had done that. \
 'My bad,' you say. \
After making a false accusation, no one in the room finds anything else you say credible and they leave. \
You move your things out of Yawnkay’s house and into your parents’ basement until you can figure out what to do next with your life. \
You watch a Tim Hoodleston marathon to try to figure out why in the world you felt the need to accuse him. \
You start with his work in his big budget superhero movies, but then make your way through his more obscure, artsy stuff. \
After watching a number of his short films, you realize that what you want to do with your life is make movies. \
You start small, editing on your laptop down in your parents’ basement. But eventually you hit it big with an artsy movie you film all in one take on a single camera in an abandoned warehouse. \
You win at a couple independent film festivals, and you ultimately get major studio gigs. \
Ironically, years later, you work on a project in which you direct Tim Hoodleston. \
By this point he’s buried the hatchet, and the two of you become the best of friends, notwithstanding his absurd accent. \
At the end of your life, you’re happy, although you do always wonder who was the person who actually killed Yawnkay East and you wonder would you have been able to figure it out if only you were a little bit smarter.",

So if Kelly Purry’s guilty, she’ll tell you now. \
Wait. You mean you actually picked correctly? \
Yes! \
You knew you’d make an amazing private detective. \
Or, at least, you were reasonably confident. \
'Well,' you say. 'I—' \
Kelly interrupts you. \
'Of course,' you say. \
You look over at Mimm May whose eyes look murderous even as tears stream from them. \
 'But if you were at the event, how did you sneak into Yawnkay’s house to kill him?' you ask. \
 'And also, Tyler has so many people around her all the time, weren’t you worried she’d have an alibi?' you ask. \
 'And why would you close the event to the public if you wanted everyone to know she made a big scene?' you say. \
She has you there. \
You decide to not think any further on these questions, or on any other contradictions inherent in the things that happened today. \
All that matters is that you caught the bad guy and justice was served. \
Huzzah! \
The bodyguard grabs Kelly Purry and holds her until the police arrive. \
The cops immediately put their egos aside, as cops are universally known to do, and instead of insisting Yawnkay committed suicide as they initially thought, they instead thank you for finding his murderer. \
Thereafter, the mayor of New York gives you an award, and you even get to meet the president. \
The one you like—not the jerk from the other party—so it’s super exciting. \
After news of the murder dies down, you never obtain fame or fortune, but you do die happy, because you have the satisfaction of knowing that you figured out who killed Yawnkay East. \
